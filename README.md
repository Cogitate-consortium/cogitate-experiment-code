# Experiment1Development
 This folder contains the experiment 1 script as well as all the material required to run it. This folder is meant to collaborate and work together to keep track of the changes of the experiment 1

Trigger delay fix modifications:

How long should the LPT trigger be ON and OFF
Is photodiode used always or just for testing?
How is the delay between beamer presentation and LTP trigger accounted for?
Can the photodiode input be recorded on the MEG as another input?
Is there any command that should be added to the PTB code to send the eye tracking information to the MEG? Or is this done automatically?
