# Cogitate Experiment Code Repository

Welcome to the Cogitate Experiment Code Repository! This repository is dedicated to hosting the code used for acquiring data from the Cogitate Consortium split by modality. Our experiments are designed to explore various aspects of cognitive science through different modalities including ECOG, FMRI, and MEEG.

## Repository Structure

The code for each modality and experiment version is organized into separate branches to ensure clarity and manageability. Below are the branches corresponding to Experiment 1:

- **MEEG-Exp1**: Contains the code used for acquiring MEEG data for Experiment 1.
- **FMRI-Exp1**: Houses the code for FMRI data acquisition for Experiment 1.
- **ECOG-Exp1**: Dedicated to the code for ECOG data acquisition for Experiment 1.

### Upcoming Experiment 2 Code

The code for Experiment 2 will be released following the same naming convention as Experiment 1, enabling easy navigation and consistency. The upcoming branches will be named as follows:

- **MEEG-Exp2**: For MEEG data acquisition for Experiment 2.
- **FMRI-Exp2**: Dedicated to FMRI data acquisition for Experiment 2.
- **ECOG-Exp2**: For ECOG data acquisition for Experiment 2.
